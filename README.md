# Matt Connors

Backend-focused developer working primarily with C# and Python.

I enjoy building structured systems, APIs, and practical tools.  
While I can work across the stack when needed, I’m strongest on the backend.

## Projects
- **[CipherPlayground](https://github.com/MattConnors365/CipherPlayground)** – Collection of common cipher implementations delivered as a C# library, API, console app, and web UI.
- **[ForecastV](https://github.com/MattConnors365/ForecastV)** – GTA V mod that syncs in-game weather with real-world conditions.
- **[RockPaperScissors](https://github.com/MattConnors365/RockPaperScissors)** – Command-line C# implementation of the classic game.
- **[cnpToolkit](https://github.com/MattConnors365/cnpToolkit)** – Generator and analyzer for Romanian national ID numbers (archived / slightly outdated).

## Tech
C#, .NET, Python, APIs, Git

## Currently
Improving backend architecture skills and exploring more structured project design.
